Alien Evolution
How you plan to incorporate object-oriented programming into the project
It is going to be in a set of classes. 
There will be a board class and a cell class. 
The board class will use a 2-d vector or array to display the board. 
The cells class will create the rules for which the cells live by.
How you plan to format your initial parameters
The game will start with an empty board. The board is created by a 2-d vector or array.
One parameter will start at generation zero.
Another parameter could be around number of cells the game starts with.
How the user is able to manipulate the rules of thbe game
For a space that is 'populated (pre-determined by user, before game starts):
Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated (pre-determined by user, before game starts);
Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
Size of board will be inputted by user
As games generation progresses  the rules for which the cells play by will change. (i.e an asteroid killing the dinosaurs)
For example, the player could have access to a plague button which kills a set of cells off immediately. 
Or there could be an infection that the cells are exposed too. This would change the rules to were the if cells are connected to that cell they will be infected and you will lose those cells. If all the cell die then the game would end with loss. 

How you plan on displaying the grid to the user.
The SIZE_OF_MAP parameter is a constant of map size user entered before
* The x parameter is the x-coordinate
* The y parameter is the y-coordinate
* The mapToHide parameter is the answer board of the game
* The mapToDisplay parameter is the board to display
* The mineCheck parameter is if user want to put a marker at a certain position
